### PrimaveraXmlSaveOptions() {#PrimaveraXmlSaveOptions--}
```
public PrimaveraXmlSaveOptions()
```


Initializes a new instance of the [PrimaveraXmlSaveOptions](../../com.aspose.tasks/primaveraxmlsaveoptions) class.

### getSaveRootTask() {#getSaveRootTask--}

### getSkipSummaryAssignments() {#getSkipSummaryAssignments--}
```
public final boolean getSkipSummaryAssignments()
```


Gets a value indicating whether assignments of resources to summary tasks should be skipped during export.

Primavera software doesn't support assignments of resources to summary (WBS) tasks. Thus, export of such assignments can result in an invalid file according to Primavera's model. If true, assignments to summary tasks are skipped during export. If false (the default value), an exception will be thrown if assignment to a summary task is encountered during export.

**Returns:**
boolean - a value indicating whether assignments of resources to summary tasks should be skipped during export.
### setSaveRootTask(boolean value) {#setSaveRootTask-boolean-}
