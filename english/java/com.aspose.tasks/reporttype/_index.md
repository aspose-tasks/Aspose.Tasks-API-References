### ProjectOverview {#ProjectOverview}
```
public static final int ProjectOverview
```

### CostOverview {#CostOverview}
```
public static final int CostOverview
```


Shows the project\\u2019s start and finish dates, the current scheduled and remaining cost, % Complete and cost values for top-level tasks.

### WorkOverview {#WorkOverview}
```
public static final int WorkOverview
```


Shows baseline, actual, remaining work for each top-level task and work for work resources.

### ResourceOverview {#ResourceOverview}
```
public static final int ResourceOverview
```


Shows baseline, actual, and remaining work by resource.

### ResourceCostOverview {#ResourceCostOverview}
```
public static final int ResourceCostOverview
```


Shows baseline, actual, and remaining cost by resource.

### CriticalTasks {#CriticalTasks}
```
public static final int CriticalTasks
```


Shows project tasks that are critical.

### LateTasks {#LateTasks}
```
public static final int LateTasks
```


Shows project tasks that are late.

### Milestones {#Milestones}
```
public static final int Milestones
```


Shows milestones that are late, coming up and completed.

### UpcomingTask {#UpcomingTask}
```
public static final int UpcomingTask
```


Shows tasks that are due during the current week and tasks starting during current week.

### CostOverruns {#CostOverruns}
```
public static final int CostOverruns
```


Shows cost variance by task and resource.

### TaskCostOverview {#TaskCostOverview}
```
public static final int TaskCostOverview
```


Shows baseline, actual, and remaining cost of all top-level tasks.

### OverallocatedResources {#OverallocatedResources}
```
public static final int OverallocatedResources
```
