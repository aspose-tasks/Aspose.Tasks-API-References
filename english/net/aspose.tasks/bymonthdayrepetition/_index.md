                         RecurrencePattern = new MonthlyRecurrencePattern
                                                 {
                                                     Repetition = new ByMonthDayRepetition { DayPosition = 1, RepetitionInterval = 2 },
                                                     RecurrenceRange = new EndByRecurrenceRange
                                                                           {

                     };
project.RootTask.Children.Add(parameters);
