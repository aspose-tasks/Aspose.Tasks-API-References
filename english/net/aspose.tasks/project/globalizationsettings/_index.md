## Project.GlobalizationSettings property

Gets or sets globalization (language-specific) settings of the project.

```csharp
public GlobalizationSettings GlobalizationSettings { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

The recommended way is to use culture-invariant literals or formats throughout the project. However, if a project uses culture-specific literals, this class can be used to help the calculation engine parse those literals.
