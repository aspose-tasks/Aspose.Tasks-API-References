## Project.Recalculate method (2 of 2)

Reschedules all project tasks ids, outline levels, start/finish dates, sets early/late dates, calculates slacks, work and cost fields with optional validation.

```csharp
public void Recalculate(bool validate)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| validate | Boolean | If true the validation of recalculation will be performed. What data is validated: At the moment only basic validation of task and task link date ranges is implemented. Task's date ranges (e.g. ActualStart - ActualFinish, EarlyStart - EarlyFinish, etc.) as well as Task Links dates will be checked against the date criteria that start date is less or equal than finish date. If any of conditions described above is failed then [`RecalculationValidationException`](../../recalculationvalidationexception) will be thrown. |
