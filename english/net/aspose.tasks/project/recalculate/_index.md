## Recalculate() {#recalculate}

Reschedules all project tasks ids, outline levels, start/finish dates, sets early/late dates, calculates slacks, work and cost fields.

```csharp
public void Recalculate()
```

### Examples

Shows how to reschedule the project from start date instead of the finish one.

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project2.mpp");
project.Set(Prj.ScheduleFromStart, true);
project.Set(Prj.StartDate, new DateTime(2014, 1, 1));

// Now all tasks dates (Start, Finish, EarlyStart, EarlyFinish, LateStart, LateFinish) are calculated. To get the critical path we need to calculate slacks (can be invoked in separate thread, but only after calculation of all early/late dates)
project.Recalculate();

foreach (var task in project.CriticalPath)
{
    Console.WriteLine(task.Get(Tsk.Id));
    Console.WriteLine(task.Get(Tsk.Name));
}
```

## Recalculate(bool) {#recalculate_1}

Reschedules all project tasks ids, outline levels, start/finish dates, sets early/late dates, calculates slacks, work and cost fields with optional validation.

```csharp
public void Recalculate(bool validate)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| validate | Boolean | If true the validation of recalculation will be performed. What data is validated: At the moment only basic validation of task and task link date ranges is implemented. Task's date ranges (e.g. ActualStart - ActualFinish, EarlyStart - EarlyFinish, etc.) as well as Task Links dates will be checked against the date criteria that start date is less or equal than finish date. If any of conditions described above is failed then [`RecalculationValidationException`](../../recalculationvalidationexception) will be thrown. |

### Examples

Shows how to recalculate the project with post validation.

```csharp
var project = new Project();
var task = project.RootTask.Children.Add("t1");
task.Set(Tsk.CommitmentStart, new DateTime(2017, 6, 19, 8, 0, 0));
task.Set(Tsk.CommitmentFinish, new DateTime(2017, 6, 18, 17, 0, 0));

try
{
    // recalculate the project with post validation
    project.Recalculate(true);
}
catch (TaskValidationException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
```
