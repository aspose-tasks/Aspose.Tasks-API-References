## Examples

Shows how to read/write task properties.

```csharp
var project = new Project();

// Add task and set task properties
var task = project.RootTask.Children.Add();
task.Set(Tsk.Name, "Task1");
task.Set(Tsk.Start, new DateTime(2020, 3, 31, 8, 0, 0));
task.Set(Tsk.Finish, new DateTime(2020, 3, 31, 17, 0, 0));

var collector = new ChildTasksCollector();
TaskUtils.Apply(project.RootTask, collector, 0);

// Parse through all the collected tasks
foreach (var tsk in collector.Tasks)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Task Id: {0}", tsk.Get(Tsk.Id));
    Console.WriteLine("Task Uid: {0}", tsk.Get(Tsk.Uid));
    Console.WriteLine("Task Name: {0}", tsk.Get(Tsk.Name));
    Console.WriteLine("Task Start: {0}", tsk.Get(Tsk.Start));
    Console.WriteLine("Task Finish: {0}", tsk.Get(Tsk.Finish));
}
```
