## FilterCriteria.CriteriaRows property

Gets the list of child [`FilterCriteria`](../../filtercriteria) rows. If the filter contains more than one criterion row then the effect of an And operator is that the criteria for both rows must be met for the task or resource to be displayed as a result of this filter. The effect of an Or operator is that the criteria for one or the other row must be met.

```csharp
public List<FilterCriteria> CriteriaRows { get; }
```
