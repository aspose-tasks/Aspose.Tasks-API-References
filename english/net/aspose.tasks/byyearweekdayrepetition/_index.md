var parameters = new RecurringTaskParameters
                     {
                         TaskName = "t1",
                         Duration = project.GetDuration(1, TimeUnitType.Day),
                         RecurrencePattern = new YearlyRecurrencePattern

                                                                      },
                                                     RecurrenceRange = new EndByRecurrenceRange
                                                                           {
