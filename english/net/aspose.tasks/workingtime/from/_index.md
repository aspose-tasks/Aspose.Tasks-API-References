## WorkingTime.From property

Gets the beginning of a working time.

```csharp
public DateTime From { get; }
```

### Examples

Shows how to work with working time information.

```csharp
public void WorkWithWorkingTime()
{
    var project = new Project();
    var calendar = CreateCalendar(project);
    project.Set(Prj.Calendar, calendar);

    Console.WriteLine("Work Week Number: " + calendar.WeekDays.Count);

    // This data is all about "Details." button you can set special working times for special WeekDay or even make it nonworking
    List<WeekDay> weekDays = calendar.WeekDays.ToList();
    foreach (var day in weekDays)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(day.DayType.ToString());

        // You can further traverse through working times and display these
        foreach (var workingTime in day.WorkingTimes)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(workingTime.From);
            Console.WriteLine(workingTime.To);
        }
    }
}

public static Calendar CreateCalendar(Project project)
{
    var calendar = project.Calendars.Add("MyCalendar", project.Calendars.GetByName("Standard"));
    var workingTimes = new List<WorkingTime>
                           {
                               new WorkingTime(new DateTime(1, 1, 1, 9, 0, 0), new DateTime(1, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)),
                               new WorkingTime(new DateTime(1, 1, 1, 13, 0, 0), new DateTime(1, 1, 1, 18, 0, 0))
                           };

    calendar.WeekDays.Add(new WeekDay(DayType.Monday, workingTimes));
    calendar.WeekDays.Add(new WeekDay(DayType.Tuesday, workingTimes));
    calendar.WeekDays.Add(new WeekDay(DayType.Wednesday, workingTimes));
    calendar.WeekDays.Add(new WeekDay(DayType.Thursday, workingTimes));
    calendar.WeekDays.Add(new WeekDay(DayType.Friday, workingTimes));
    calendar.WeekDays.Add(new WeekDay(DayType.Saturday));
    calendar.WeekDays.Add(new WeekDay(DayType.Sunday));

    return calendar;
}
```
