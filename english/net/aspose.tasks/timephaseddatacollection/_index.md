## TimephasedDataCollection class

Represents a collection of [`TimephasedData`](../timephaseddata) objects.

```csharp
public abstract class TimephasedDataCollection : IList<TimephasedData>
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [TimephasedDataCollection](timephaseddatacollection)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`TimephasedDataCollection`](../timephaseddatacollection) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Count](../../aspose.tasks/timephaseddatacollection/count) { get; } | Gets the number of objects contained in this [`TimephasedDataCollection`](../timephaseddatacollection) object. |
| [IsReadOnly](../../aspose.tasks/timephaseddatacollection/isreadonly) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether the ICollection is read-only. |
| [Item](../../aspose.tasks/timephaseddatacollection/item) { get; set; } | Returns the element at the specified index. The set accessor is not supported. property to set timephased data. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Add](../../aspose.tasks/timephaseddatacollection/add)(TimephasedData) | Adds [`TimephasedData`](../timephaseddata) instance to this collection object. |
| [AddRange](../../aspose.tasks/timephaseddatacollection/addrange)(IEnumerable&lt;TimephasedData&gt;) | Adds a collection of [`TimephasedData`](../timephaseddata) instances to this collection object. |
| [Clear](../../aspose.tasks/timephaseddatacollection/clear)() | Removes all items from the [`TimephasedDataCollection`](../timephaseddatacollection). |
| [Contains](../../aspose.tasks/timephaseddatacollection/contains)(TimephasedData) | Determines whether the [`TimephasedDataCollection`](../timephaseddatacollection) contains a specific value. |
| [CopyTo](../../aspose.tasks/timephaseddatacollection/copyto)(TimephasedData[], int) | Copies the elements of the [`TimephasedDataCollection`](../timephaseddatacollection) to an Array, starting at a particular Array index. |
| [GetEnumerator](../../aspose.tasks/timephaseddatacollection/getenumerator)() | Returns an enumerator for this collection. |
| [Remove](../../aspose.tasks/timephaseddatacollection/remove)(TimephasedData) | Removes [`TimephasedData`](../timephaseddata) instance from this collection object. |
| [SelectBetweenStartAndFinish](../../aspose.tasks/timephaseddatacollection/selectbetweenstartandfinish)(TimephasedDataType, DateTime, DateTime) | Selects all time phases between *startTime* and *finishTime*. Has O(log n) complexity in average case. |
| [ToList](../../aspose.tasks/timephaseddatacollection/tolist)() | Converts the [`TimephasedDataCollection`](../timephaseddatacollection) object to a list of [`TimephasedData`](../timephaseddata) objects. |

### Examples

Shows how to work with timephased data collections.

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project1.mpp");

var resource = project.Resources.Add("Resource 1");
resource.Set(Rsc.Type, ResourceType.Work);

var resource2 = project.Resources.Add("Resource 2");
resource2.Set(Rsc.Type, ResourceType.Work);

var task = project.RootTask.Children.Add("Task 1");
task.Set(Tsk.Start, new DateTime(2019, 11, 11, 8, 0, 0));
task.Set(Tsk.Duration, project.GetDuration(24, TimeUnitType.Hour));
task.Set(Tsk.Work, project.GetDuration(3d, TimeUnitType.Hour));
task.Set(Tsk.Finish, new DateTime(2019, 11, 13, 17, 0, 0));

var task2 = project.RootTask.Children.Add("Task 2");
task2.Set(Tsk.Start, new DateTime(2019, 11, 11, 8, 0, 0));
task2.Set(Tsk.Duration, project.GetDuration(24, TimeUnitType.Hour));
task2.Set(Tsk.Work, project.GetDuration(3d, TimeUnitType.Hour));
task2.Set(Tsk.Finish, new DateTime(2019, 11, 13, 17, 0, 0));

var assignment = project.ResourceAssignments.Add(task, resource);
