If ParentProject.CalculationMode is Manual the method will calculate only task id, outline level and outline numbers automatically. If ParentProject.CalculationMode is Automatic the method reschedules all project's tasks automatically (start/finish dates, sets early/late dates, calculates slacks, work and cost fields, recalculates ids and outline levels).

```csharp
public void MoveToSibling(Task beforeTask)
```
