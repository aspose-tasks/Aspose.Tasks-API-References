## Examples

Shows how to read/write Asn.Uid property.

```csharp
var project = new Project();

var task = project.RootTask.Children.Add("Task 1");
task.Set(Tsk.Start, new DateTime(2000, 1, 3, 8, 0, 0));
task.Set(Tsk.Duration, project.GetDuration(8));

var resource = project.Resources.Add("Resource 1");
resource.Set(Rsc.Type, ResourceType.Work);

var assignment = project.ResourceAssignments.Add(task, resource);
assignment.Set(Asn.Uid, 30);

Console.WriteLine("UID: " + assignment.Get(Asn.Uid));
```
