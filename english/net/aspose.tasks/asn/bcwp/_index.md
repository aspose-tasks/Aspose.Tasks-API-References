// Print resource assignment costs
foreach (var assignment in project.ResourceAssignments)
{
    Console.WriteLine(assignment.Get(Asn.Cost));
    Console.WriteLine(assignment.Get(Asn.ACWP));

    // CV = BCWP - ACWP
    Console.WriteLine(assignment.Get(Asn.CV));

    Console.WriteLine(assignment.Get(Asn.BCWP));
    Console.WriteLine(assignment.Get(Asn.BCWS));

    // SV = BCWP - BCWS
    Console.WriteLine(assignment.Get(Asn.SV));
}
```
