var calendar = project.Calendars.GetByUid(1);
var weekDay1 = calendar.WeekDays[1];
var weekDay2 = calendar.WeekDays[2];

// the hash code of a calendar is based on:
// weekday.DayType
// weekday.FromDate
// weekday.ToDate
// weekday.WorkingTimes
Console.WriteLine("WeekDay 1 Day Type: " + weekDay1.DayType);
Console.WriteLine("WeekDay 1 Day Working: " + weekDay1.DayWorking);
Console.WriteLine("WeekDay 1 From Date: " + weekDay1.FromDate);
Console.WriteLine("WeekDay 1 From Date: " + weekDay1.ToDate);
Console.WriteLine("WeekDay 1 WorkingTimes: " + weekDay1.WorkingTimes);
Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine("WeekDay 2 Day Type: " + weekDay2.DayType);
Console.WriteLine("WeekDay 2 Day Working: " + weekDay2.DayWorking);
Console.WriteLine("WeekDay 2 From Date: " + weekDay2.FromDate);
Console.WriteLine("WeekDay 2 From Date: " + weekDay2.ToDate);
Console.WriteLine("WeekDay 2 WorkingTimes: " + weekDay2.WorkingTimes);
Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine("Week Day 1 Hash Code: {0}", weekDay1.GetHashCode());
Console.WriteLine("Week Day 2 Hash Code: {0}", weekDay2.GetHashCode());
