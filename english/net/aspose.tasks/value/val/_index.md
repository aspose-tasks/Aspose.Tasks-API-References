## Value.Val property

Gets or sets the actual value in internal representation. Prefer using strongly typed properties which are listed below.

```csharp
public string Val { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

If you want to set Text value prefer using strongly typed [`StringValue`](../stringvalue) property.

If you want to set Number or Cost value prefer using strongly typed [`NumericValue`](../numericvalue) property.

If you want to set Date/Start/Finish values, prefer using strongly typed [`DateTimeValue`](../datetimevalue) property.

If you want to set Duration value prefer using strongly typed [`Duration`](../duration) property.

If your type wasn't listed, use `Val` property.
