| [SetMaterialResourceUnits](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/setmaterialresourceunits/)(double, RateScaleType) | Sets units for assignment of a material resource with variable material consumption. The variable material consumption means that as the assignment duration changes, the quantity of materials used changes proportionally. |
| [SplitTask](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/splittask/)(DateTime, DateTime, Calendar) | Splits task into two parts. |
| [TimephasedDataFromTaskDuration](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/timephaseddatafromtaskduration/)(Calendar) | Generates list of time phased data based on the task duration and the scheduled start date. |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/tostring/)() | Returns short string representation of the instance of the `ResourceAssignment` class. The exact details of the representation are unspecified and subject to change. |

## Examples

Shows how to create an assignment and get/set common assignment properties.

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "BudgetWorkAndCost.mpp");

var task = project.RootTask.Children.Add("Task");
task.Set(Tsk.Start, new DateTime(2020, 4, 2, 8, 0, 0));
task.Set(Tsk.Duration, project.GetDuration(1));
task.Set(Tsk.Finish, new DateTime(2020, 4, 2, 17, 0, 0));
var resource = project.Resources.Add("Resource");
var resourceAssignment = project.ResourceAssignments.Add(task, resource);
resourceAssignment.Set(Asn.Start, new DateTime(2020, 4, 2, 8, 0, 0));
resourceAssignment.Set(Asn.Work, project.GetWork(1));
resourceAssignment.Set(Asn.Finish, new DateTime(2020, 4, 2, 17, 0, 0));

Console.WriteLine(resourceAssignment.Get(Asn.Start));
Console.WriteLine(resourceAssignment.Get(Asn.Work));
Console.WriteLine(resourceAssignment.Get(Asn.Finish));
```
