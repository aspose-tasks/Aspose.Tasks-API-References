| [TimephasedData](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/timephaseddata) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the instance of [`TimephasedDataCollection`](../timephaseddatacollection) class containing elements of [`TimephasedData`](./timephaseddata) class. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Delete](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/delete)() | Deletes resource assignment from project assignments collection. |
| override [Equals](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/equals#equals_1)(object) | Returns a value indicating whether this instance is equal to a specified object. |
| [Equals](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/equals#equals)(ResourceAssignment) | Returns a value indicating whether this instance is equal to a specified instance of the [`ResourceAssignment`](../resourceassignment) class. |
| [Get&lt;T&gt;](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/get)(Key&lt;T, AsnKey&gt;) | Returns the value to which the property is mapped in this container. |
| override [GetHashCode](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/gethashcode)() | Returns a hash code value for the instance of the [`ResourceAssignment`](../resourceassignment) class. |
| [GetTimephasedData](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/gettimephaseddata#gettimephaseddata)(DateTime, DateTime) | Returns [`TimephasedDataCollection`](../timephaseddatacollection) object with the instances of [`TimephasedData`](./timephaseddata) class within given start and end dates of AssignmentWork. |
| [GetTimephasedData](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/gettimephaseddata#gettimephaseddata_1)(DateTime, DateTime, TimephasedDataType) | Returns the instance [`TimephasedDataCollection`](../timephaseddatacollection) class containing instances of [`TimephasedData`](./timephaseddata) class within given start and end dates of specified [`TimephasedDataType`](../timephaseddatatype). |
| [MakeTPs](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/maketps)(DateTime, TimeSpan, Calendar, List&lt;TimephasedData&gt;, bool, int) | Generates a list of time phased data. |
| [Set&lt;T&gt;](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/set)(Key&lt;T, AsnKey&gt;, T) | Maps the specified property to the specified value in this container. |
| [SplitTask](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/splittask)(DateTime, DateTime, Calendar) | Splits task into two parts. |
| [TimephasedDataFromTaskDuration](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/timephaseddatafromtaskduration)(Calendar) | Generates list of time phased data based on the task duration and the scheduled start date. |
| override [ToString](../../aspose.tasks/resourceassignment/tostring)() | Returns short string representation of the instance of the [`ResourceAssignment`](../resourceassignment) class. The exact details of the representation are unspecified and subject to change. |

### Examples

Shows how to create an assignment and get/set common assignment properties.

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "BudgetWorkAndCost.mpp");

var task = project.RootTask.Children.Add("Task");
task.Set(Tsk.Start, new DateTime(2020, 4, 2, 8, 0, 0));
task.Set(Tsk.Duration, project.GetDuration(1));
task.Set(Tsk.Finish, new DateTime(2020, 4, 2, 17, 0, 0));
var resource = project.Resources.Add("Resource");
var resourceAssignment = project.ResourceAssignments.Add(task, resource);
resourceAssignment.Set(Asn.Start, new DateTime(2020, 4, 2, 8, 0, 0));
resourceAssignment.Set(Asn.Work, project.GetWork(1));
resourceAssignment.Set(Asn.Finish, new DateTime(2020, 4, 2, 17, 0, 0));

Console.WriteLine(resourceAssignment.Get(Asn.Start));
Console.WriteLine(resourceAssignment.Get(Asn.Work));
Console.WriteLine(resourceAssignment.Get(Asn.Finish));
```
