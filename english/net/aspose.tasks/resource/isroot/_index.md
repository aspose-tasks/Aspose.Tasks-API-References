## Resource.IsRoot property

Gets the flag indicating whether resource is a root resource. Root resource is a special resource which is intended to support internals of MS Project's formats and is not intended to be used directly from the user's code.

```csharp
public virtual bool IsRoot { get; }
```

### Examples

Shows how to use IsRoot property to skip root resource.

```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "ResourceCosts.mpp");

foreach (var resource in project.Resources)
{
    if (resource.IsRoot)
    {
        continue;
    }

    Console.WriteLine(resource.Get(Rsc.Name));
}
```
