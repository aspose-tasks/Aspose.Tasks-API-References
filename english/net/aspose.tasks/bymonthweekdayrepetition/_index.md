```csharp
var project = new Project(DataDir + "Project1.mpp");
var parameters = new RecurringTaskParameters
                     {
                         TaskName = "t1",
                         Duration = project.GetDuration(1, TimeUnitType.Day),
                         RecurrencePattern = new MonthlyRecurrencePattern
                                                 {
                                                     Repetition = new ByMonthWeekDayRepetition
                                                                      {

                                                                      },
